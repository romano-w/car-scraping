Fixtures capture small slices of HTML used in tests.

To update a fixture:
- Load a real search result page in your browser.
- Use "View Source" or `curl` to copy the HTML for a couple of listings.
- Remove unrelated markup, scripts, and personal data.
- Keep only the minimal elements required by the parser (link, price, mileage,
  dealer, location, etc.).
- Preserve two listings so tests can exercise filtering logic.

Trimmed fixtures make tests fast and focused while still covering required fields.
